// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// 1. Planning
// 2. Analysis of Requirements
// 3. Design
// 4. Implementation
// 5. Testing & Integration
// 6. Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This step focuses in on exactly what will be expected of the software being developed."
const design = "This part of the life cycle is all about creating software architecture, prototype, and a 'users end' design."
const implementation = "This step is where the coders actually bring the software to life with coding, sometimes using thousands of lines of code (KLOC's)."
const testingAndIntegration = "This step of the life cycle focuses on testing written code for bugs and other problems in the code. Here, the testing and quality assurance team works together to test and report the bugs to the development team."
const maintain = "This step is important for changing expectations and requirements of the product. It is essentially updating the code."
